# Note Taker Application

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are known as Content Management Systems (CMS).

This application allows the end user to modify an employee tracking database. They will be able to view all of the tables in the database through the use of a CLI. In addition to viewing, the end user will be able to add roles, departmetns and employees to the database.
